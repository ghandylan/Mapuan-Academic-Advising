# Revolutionizing Academic Advising: Mapúan Queue System with SMS Integration

### What
The Mapua Academic Advising is a web-based live queueing system built using Flask and MariaDB. This is a proposed solution to Mapua's current academic advising during the University's enrolment period. 

### Why
It aims to assist professors and students by incorporating a streamlined and unified queue system to avoid the hassle of opening multiple websites at once. Mapúan Academic Advising provides professors with an easy-to-use platform for managing student queues, while students can view their queue status in real-time and receive SMS notifications when it's their turn. By providing a more efficient and organized system for academic advising, the application aims to help students and professors save time and focus on more important tasks.
