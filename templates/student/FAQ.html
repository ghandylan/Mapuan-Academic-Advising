        <br>The Mapuan academic advising is a web application dedicated to resolving enrollment concerns of currently
        enrolled Mapuan students. This includes scheduling concerns, missing requirements, document requests, grade
        changes, section changes, and more.

        <br>
        <br>2. Select which professor you choose to resolve your problem (You may also see their queue line).
        <br>
        <br>3. After selecting the professor, fill out the details on the advising request form.
        <br>
        <br>4. There would be an SMS confirmation sent to your mobile phone.
        <br>
